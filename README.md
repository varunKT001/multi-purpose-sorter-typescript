# ⚖ Multipurpose Sorter

This project is made to learn about code re-use with the use of **Abstract classes** and **typescript + classes** design pattern.

## What it does 🤔?

The project implements a multi-purpose sorter (_bubble-sort_) which can sort `Array of numbers`, `Strings`, and `Linked lists` using the same implementations of `sort()` method without using any type-guards.

That's all it does 🙂

> PS: No screenshot ❌ clone it an run it 🙂 (_If by any chance you want_)
